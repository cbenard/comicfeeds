				<description><![CDATA[Gabe: Dabe has delivered a new shirt design that I find hits a bit too close to home.    I remember very vividly when I broke my Pokemon card game addiction. I was free and clear until my son Gabe got hooked. Now I&#8217;m right back in!  -Gabe out]]></description>

				<link>http://penny-arcade.com/news/post/2015/07/31/pax-dev-schedule-is-out</link>
				<description><![CDATA[Gabe: I have three pieces of PAX related news to share with you.  1. If you are attending PAX Dev and you would like to know when all the cool stuff that is happening there is happening then check out this schedule.   2. The Dates for PAX South are January 29, 30, 31.  3. We are &#8220;planning&#8221; on launching ticket sales for PAX South on September 16th 2015.  4. I hate when I&#8217;m trying to get to the World&#8217;s Grave but I get turned around at the Circle of Bones and I end up in the Skull Orchard. One of those places is not actually in Destiny.   -Gabe Out]]></description>

				<link>http://penny-arcade.com/news/post/2015/07/31/nightlight-and-my-dad</link>
				<description><![CDATA[Gabe: Nightlight is wrapped up now and for those who have no idea what’s going on, I posted a breakdown in the forum.   When my Dad and I were at the Child’s Play golf tournament he saw me have a conversation with Kiko and Dabe about Nightlight. It was before I left for my vacation and I was really struggling to figure out what the monsters in this world would be like. The three of us were bouncing around ideas and my Dad just sat there and listened. We talked about the particular child’s fears informing each monster design. Dabe had the idea of getting real kids to draw monsters and then&hellip;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tycho: Grace, Part Six can be found here. I knew David Edery when he worked at Microsoft, what seems like a thousand years ago, under circumstances you will absorb here in a moment.&nbsp; I think he was more or less driven insane by it.&nbsp; Now he works at Spry Fox with an incredibly small crew, making all kinds of weird shit and getting incredibly bad business advice from ME.&nbsp; I think he does what I do for Mike, which is to say, his primary goal over there is to help other people do what they do best, and it would be hard to put an exact label on it.   Hey, thank you for authorizing On The&hellip;]]></description>

				<title><![CDATA[News Post: POOPING IS LOGICAL!]]></title>
				<link>http://penny-arcade.com/news/post/2015/07/30/pooping-is-logical</link>
				<description><![CDATA[Gabe: For some reason I have a bunch of writer friends. In fact now that I think about it, I probably know more writers than I do visual artists. I like writers because they always get very excited when they see drawings based on their stories. Taking the ideas they have in their heads and turning them into pictures is like a magic trick to many writers. Maybe that&#8217;s why I like them so much. When I hang out with writers I&#8217;m the best artist in the room!   Gary Whitta is one of these writer friends and a few months ago he came to me with an idea. He wanted to make a book for geek parents&hellip;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tycho: Grace, Part Five can be found here.Erik Wolpaw, from Old Man Murray to Portal and Portal 2, you must certainly be considered the world&#8217;s foremost writer of gaming humor - both inside and outside games themselves.&nbsp; And your last name is just pronounced regular old Wolpaw, which is way easier to pronounce than Chmielarz.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a much more considerate name.&nbsp; But, back to the other thing: why is the best in the Goddamn business writing Team Fortress comics exclusively, and only those, forever?

				<description><![CDATA[Gabe: Our Automata Kickstarter is just about funded and we have just posted a new update over on the site. We&#8217;ve added another pin design as an optional ADD-ON. Here&#8217;s the design:    This is going to a be a really slick pin. We&#8217;re gonna do it in two layers so that Carl&#8217;s mask sits on top of his face. Similar to the 15 year anniversary pin.   Thanks so much for your support of this Kickstarter. We&#8217;ve just got a little bit more to go!  -Gabe out]]></description>
